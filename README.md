## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd multiplayer-grid-game
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

## üéÆ How to Use

### For Players:

1. **Join the Game**: Enter your name on the landing page
2. **Select a Cell**: Click any cell in the 10x10 grid
3. **Enter Character**: Type any Unicode character (üòä, ‚ô•, üéÆ, etc.)
4. **Submit**: Click "Submit" to update the grid
5. **Wait for Cooldown**: You must wait 60 seconds before your next update
6. **View History**: Click "View History" to see all past updates

### For Testing Multiple Players:

- Open the application in multiple browser windows/tabs
- Or open in different browsers
- Or use incognito/private mode
- Each instance represents a different player

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Real-time Communication

- Uses Socket.IO for bidirectional event-based communication
- Events handled:
  - `join`: Player connects and receives initial state
  - `update-cell`: Player updates a cell
  - `cell-updated`: Broadcast to all players
  - `players-count`: Real-time player count updates
  - `cooldown-started`: Timer starts after update
  - `get-history`: Request historical data
  - `error`: Validation and error messages

### State Management

- **Backend**: In-memory storage (can be upgraded to MongoDB)
- **Frontend**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Grid State**: 2D array synchronized across all clients

### Cooldown Logic

- Server-side validation prevents cheating
- Client-side timer for UX
- Timestamp-based calculation
- Graceful handling of page refresh

### History Feature

- All updates stored with timestamp
- Grouped by second for better UX
- Time-travel functionality to view past states
- Statistics dashboard

## üé® Design Decisions

### UI/UX Choices:

1. **Color Coding**: Visual distinction between own cells (green) and others (blue)
2. **Gradient Background**: Modern, eye-catching design
3. **Animations**: Smooth transitions and hover effects
4. **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate error messages and cooldown timer
5. **Responsive Grid**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### Technical Choices:

1. **TypeScript**: Type safety reduces bugs
2. **Vite**: Fast development experience
3. **Socket.IO**: Reliable real-time communication
4. **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid UI development
5. **Component Architecture**: Reusable, maintainable code

## ü§ñ AI Tool Usage Disclosure

As required, here is a complete disclosure of AI tools used in this project:

### Tools Used:

1. **Claude AI (Anthropic)** - Used for:
   - Initial project structure planning
   - Code architecture suggestions
   - TypeScript type definitions
   - Component design patterns
   - README documentation structure
   - Debugging assistance

### What Was AI-Generated:

- Project boilerplate and structure
- Component templates (Grid, PlayerInfo, HistoryViewer)
- Socket.IO event handler patterns
- TypeScript interfaces
- This README documentation

### What Was Manually Created:

- Business logic implementation
- Cooldown mechanism
- History grouping algorithm
- UI/UX design decisions
- Styling and animations
- Error handling specifics
- Testing and bug fixes

### Why AI Was Used:

- Speed up initial setup
- Ensure best practices
- TypeScript type safety
- Comprehensive documentation
- Reduce boilerplate code

**Note:** All AI-generated code was reviewed, tested, modified, and validated to ensure it meets the requirements and works correctly.

## üìä Performance Considerations

- **In-memory Storage**: Fast but resets on server restart (can upgrade to database)
- **Socket.IO**: Efficient for real-time updates with automatic reconnection
- **Grid Rendering**: Optimized with React keys and minimal re-renders
- **History Storage**: Unlimited growth (consider pagination for production)

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **State Persistence**: Grid resets when server restarts (by design for this assignment)
2. **No Authentication**: Players can choose any name
3. **History Size**: Unlimited growth (would need cleanup in production)
4. **Single Server**: No horizontal scaling yet
